# Catalogue Parser for Coke Studios

This is a simple catalogue parser for coke studios / coke music / mycoke.

## Usage

Using node, you can run the index.js file:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will use the default catalogue file. You can also specify the path to the file:

```bash
node index.js path/to/catalogue.txt
```

It should spit everything out into the out directory in categories, and also into an `all.json` file.
